## 🤦 The Problem

Tired of Windows 11's Start Menu? So are we:

- 🐌 **Slow as a Snail** - Seconds of waiting just to search for an app
- 🌐 **Unwanted Web Searches** - Typed "Excel"? Here are 20 Bing results nobody asked for
- 💰 **Advertisements** - Because what you need when searching for an app are Store app suggestions
- 🎯 **Irrelevant Results** - Shows you everything EXCEPT what you're looking for
- 😤 **Frustrating** - A 2010 user experience... but in 2024

## ✨ The Solution

**Oxistart** replaces Windows Start Menu with something that actually works:

### 🚀 Fast. REALLY Fast.

Instant search with no delays. Type and see results in **milliseconds**, not seconds.

### 🎯 Smart

- **Fuzzy search**: Type "chr" and find "Chrome"
- **Learns from you**: Apps you use most appear first
- **Built-in calculator**: Type `2+2` and get the result instantly
- **No clutter**: Only your applications. No web results, no ads, no distractions.

### ⌨️ Productive

- `Enter` → Open app
- `Alt+Enter` → Run as administrator
- `Shift+Enter` → Open file location
- `Esc` → Close menu

**Oxistart is what the Start Menu should have always been: fast, simple, and useful.**
